# South Florida DPLA Hub

This repo is for documentation of the South Florida DPLA sub-hub. Scripts and other code needed for implentation will be stored in the main repo, and general documentation will be on the repo's [wiki](https://github.com/UMiamiLibraries/sf-dpla-subhub/wiki).

This project will aggreagate metadata for eventual ingestion at [DPLA](http://dp.la).
